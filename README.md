# SUBARRAY-DIVISION
This program solves the “Birthday Chocolate” problem by checking how many ways a list of integers can form segments of length `m` whose sum equals `d`. The `birthday` function loops through the list, takes each group of `m` consecutive numbers, calculates their sum, and counts how many of these sums match `d`. The `Main` method reads the input values, sends them to the function, and prints the final count as the result.
