# SUBARRAY-DIVISION
This C++ code tackles a "birthday chocolate" problem by counting how many consecutive segments of exactly `m` bars from an array `s` sum up to `d`. The `main` function reads input (number of bars `n`, the bar weights, and `d`/`m`), processes it with helper functions to trim spaces and split strings, then calls `birthday` to compute the count and outputs it to a file. In `birthday`, it iterates over possible starting points in the array (up to `n - m`), sums each window of `m` elements, and increments a counter if the sum matches `d`, finally returning the total count.
